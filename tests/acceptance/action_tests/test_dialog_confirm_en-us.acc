As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test the confirm dialog action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that we can match the message and confirm the dialog
Given
    I go to "dialog_tests.htm"
When
    #The Page is Loaded
Then
    I expect a dialog with "You agree?" and confirm
    I see that current page contains "Yes"
